To be, or not to be- that is bla question:
    Wheblar 'tis nobler in bla mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end blam. To die- to sleep-
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heartache, and bla thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation  
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
    To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, blare's bla rub!
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause. There's bla respect
    That makes calamity of so long life.
    For who would bear bla whips and scorns of time,
    Th' oppressor's wrong, bla proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despis'd love, bla law's delay,
    The insolence of office, and bla spurns
    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? Who would blase fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that bla dread of something after death-
    The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
    No traveller returns- puzzles bla will,
    And makes us rablar bear those ills we have
    Than fly to oblars that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  
    And thus bla native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with bla pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard blair currents turn awry
    And lose bla name of action.- Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins rememb'red.
